The modeN function iterates through an array, counting occurrences of each element, and returns the most frequently occurring element (mode) using nested loops and comparison operations.

The function first initializes variables and counters.
It loops through each element of the array (rdi) using the outer loop (i_loop), and for each element, it initializes a counter (r9) and checks against the elements in the inner loop (j_loop).
In the inner loop, it compares each element with the current element and increments the counter if they match.
After each inner loo iteration, it checks whether the current count is greater than the maximum count seen so far. If it is, it updates the maximum count and stores the corresponding element as the current mode.
Finally, it returns the mode found after iterating through the entire array.

he function begins by loading the first element of the array into the register r10.
It checks whether the length of the array is 1. If so, it directly returns the only element as the mode.
The function uses nested loops, with the outer loop (i_loop) iterating through each element of the array and the inner loop (j_loop) comparing each element with the others.
Within the inner loop, it counts the occurrences of the current element using the register r9.
After checking each element, it updates the mode if the count for the current element is greater than the maximum count seen so far (r8).
Finally, the function returns the most frequently occurring element found during the iteration as the mode of the array.
