# x86_64 Assembly Codes Repository

Welcome to my x86_64 Assembly Codes repository! This collection features various assembly programs written in NASM (Netwide Assembler). Below is an overview of the available codes:

## Code List

1. **Arithmetic Operations**: Basic arithmetic operations, showcasing the use of registers and arithmetic instructions. (a^2-b^2) and (a^3-b^3)/(a-b)

2. **Even And Odd Numbers Counter**: A program that counts the number of even and odd numbers in an array.

3. **Linear Search**: An implementation of linear search algorithm in assembly.

4. **Min-Max Finder**: Find the minimum and maximum elements in an array.

5. **Mode Finder**: Determine the mode (most frequently occurring element) in an array.

6. **Matrix Addition (n x n)**: Addition of two square matrices of size n x n.

7. **Matrix Multiplication (n x n)**: Multiplication of two square matrices of size n x n.

## Background

During my coursework, I faced the challenge of running x86_64 assembly codes on my Mac, which is equipped with an ARM64 processor. Given that my coursework primarily covered x86_64 architecture, I encountered compatibility issues when trying to execute the assembly programs.

To address this challenge, I created this repository to organize and track all the x86_64 assembly codes I developed. The repository serves as a reference for myself and aims to benefit others who may encounter similar challenges. It provides a centralized location for x86_64 assembly code examples, allowing easy access and exploration.

## Compatibility Note

These codes are specifically written for x86_64 architecture. If you are using a different architecture, such as ARM64, adjustments may be necessary for compatibility.

## Usage

Feel free to explore and use these codes as references for your projects or coursework. Each code file includes comments for better understanding.

## Contributing

If you have suggestions, find issues, or want to contribute additional x86_64 assembly code examples, please open an issue or submit a pull request. Contributions are welcome!

Happy coding!
